# Windows_95_Rice

A minimalist Windows 95-inspired rice setup for the i3 window manager.

Components:
- Window Manager: i3
- Compositor: jonaburg/picom
- Icons & GTK Theme: grassmunk/Chicago95
- App Launcher: rofi
- Web Browser Styling: osem598/Firefox-98
- Terminal Emulator: Terminator
- Status Bar: polybar
- Clock Widget: conky
- Font: DepartureMono Nerd Font

The Chrome/Firefox visual style is based on osem598's Firefox-98 project. I made a minor customization by appending a script at the end of the userChrome.css file to modify the font.
