# Windows_95_Rice

A minimalist Windows 95-inspired rice setup for the i3 window manager.

Components:
- Window Manager: i3
- Compositor: jonaburg/picom
- Icons & GTK Theme: grassmunk/Chicago95
- App Launcher: rofi
- Web Browser Styling: osem598/Firefox-98
- Terminal Emulator: Terminator
- Status Bar: polybar
- Font: DepartureMono Nerd Font
- Animated Wallpaper: mmhobi7/xwinwrap

The Chrome/Firefox style is based on osem598's Firefox-98 project. I made a small adjustment by adding a script at the end to the userChrome.css file to change the font.

# UPDATE
Put the 'wallpapers' folder into your '.config' directory and it should work with xwinwrap if you want to use my animated wallpaper.
